## Project overview
Gestational duration is a critical determinant of neonatal survival and health. While genetic and environmental factors both contribute, their interaction remains under-explored.  
This project investigates how **interpregnancy interval (IPI)** and a **history of miscarriage** may modify the effects of maternal genetic variants on gestational duration, using large-scale genomic and reproductive data.

Key research aims:
- Assess whether maternal genetic contributions to gestational duration differ across short, intermediate, and long interpregnancy intervals (IPI).
- Explore genome-wide gene–environment interactions (G×E) with IPI and miscarriage history.
- Functionally annotate candidate variants and loci (e.g., *ATRNL1*, *DPYSL3*) and investigate their enrichment in pathways linked to epigenetic regulation, uterine receptivity, and immune adaptation.


## Data
- **Cohort**: [Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)](https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/).  
- **Genotype data**: MoBaGenetics release (hg19/GRCh37).  
- **Phenotypes**: Linked registry data (Medical Birth Registry of Norway, MBRN).  
  Due to data protection regulations, raw MoBa data cannot be shared in this repository.
