MissingOutputException in rule cleaned_data in file /mnt/scratch/agnes/gene-IPI/Snakefile, line 4:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
result/phenotype/IDs_extract.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job cleaned_data since they might be corrupted:
results/phenotype/filtered_pregnancies.csv, results/plots/phenotype/ipi_distribution_corrected.png, results/plots/phenotype/ipi_density_IPI.png, results/plots/phenotype/ipi_ushape.png, results/plots/phenotype/ipi_delivery_type.png, results/plots/phenotype/ipi_stillbirth_vs_livebirth.png
Shutting down, this might take some time.
